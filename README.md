# automated-docker-build
In this assignment, we will look at automated builds. Automated builds are those that you can link to your GitHub account, and as you update the code in your code repository, you can have the image automatically built on Docker Hub. We will look at all the pieces required to do so. By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to automate your own builds.
